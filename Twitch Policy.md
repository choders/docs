# Monstercat Twitch Policy

    Jan 27, 2019. Revision 1.2.3

This policy sets out the open policy for all streaming & VOD content found on
Twitch using Monstercat's music catalog.

## VOD
We will not mute VODs that contain Monstercat's music. While Twitch's Audio Recognition system only allows for audio muting, we ask that you only include Monstercat music in your VODs if you have [purchased a Twitch whitelist license](http://www.monstercat.com/account/services/?vendor=twitch).

## Streaming
If you include Monstercat in your streams we ask that you [purchase a Twitch whitelist license](http://www.monstercat.com/account/services/?vendor=twitch).

If you are not listening to Monstercat FM, we ask that you use XSplit, OBS, or similar tools to show your audience which songs are being streamed live.

If Monstercat music accounts for the majority of music used in your stream,
we ask that you link to

## Amendments to this policy

This policy may change from time to time. As Twitch evolves and adapts its policies we are forced to adapt our own.
